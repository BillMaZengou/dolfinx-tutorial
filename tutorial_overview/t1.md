The goal of this tutorial is to solve one of the most basic PDEs, the Poisson equations, with a few lines of code in FEniCS-X. We start by introducing the most fundamental FEniCS objects, such as `Mesh`, `Function`, `FunctionSpace`, `TrialFunction` and `TestFunction`, and learn how to write a basic PDE solver. 
This will include:
- How to formulate a mathematical variational problem
- How to apply boundary conditions
- How to solve the discrete linear system
- How to visualize the solution

The Poisson equation is the following boundary-value problem

[[ -\nabla^2 u(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}) \quad \mathbf{x} \in \Omega]]

[[ u(\mathbf{x}) = u_D(\mathbf{x})\quad \mathbf{x} \in \partial\Omega]]

Here, $u=u(\mathbf{x})$ is the unknown function, $f=f(\mathbf{x})$ is a prescribed function, $\nabla^2$ the Laplace operator, often written as $\Delta$, $\Omega$ the spatial domain, and $\partial\Omega$ is the boundary of $\Omega$. The Poisson problem, including both the PDE $-\nabla^2 u = f$ and the boundary condition $u=u_D$ on $\partial\Omega$, is an example of a _boundary-value problem_, which must be precisely state before it makes sense to start solving it numerically with FEniCS-X. 

In the two dimensional space with coordinates $x$ and $y$, we can expand the Poisson equation as

[[ -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} -
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y)]]

The unknown $u$ is now a function of two variables, $u=u(x,y)$, defined over the two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. 

The Poisson equation arises in numerous physical contexts, including
heat conduction, electrostatics, diffusion of substances, twisting of
elastic rods, inviscid fluid flow, and water waves. Moreover, the
equation appears in numerical splitting strategies for more complicated
systems of PDEs, in particular the Navier--Stokes equations.

Solving a boundary value problem in FEniCS consists of the following steps:

1. Identify the computational domain $\Omega$, the PDE, and its corresponding boundary conditions and source terms $f$.
2. Reformulate the PDE as a finite element variational problem.
3. Write a Python program defining the computational domain, the boundary conditions, the variational problem and the source terms, using FEniCS.
4. Run the Python program to solve the boundary-value problem. Optionally, you can extend the program to derive quantities such as fluxes and averages,
and visualize the results.

As we have already covered step 1., we shall now cover step 2-4.

## Finite element variational formulation

FEniCS is based on the finite element method, which is a general and
efficient mathematical machinery for the numerical solution of
PDEs. The starting point for the finite element methods is a PDE
expressed in \emph{variational form}. For readers not familiar with variational problems, it is suggested to reading a proper book on the finite element method in addition, as this tutorial is meant as a brief introduction to the subject. See the [original tutorial]([The FEniCS tutorial](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319524610)) (Chapter 1.6.2).

The basic recipe for turning a PDE into a variational problem is:
- Multiply the PDE by a function $v$
- Integrate the resulting equation over the domain $\Omega$
- Perform integration by parts of terms with second order derivatives. 

The function $v$ which multiplies the PDE is called a _test function_. The unknown function $u$ that is to be approximated is referred to as a _trial function_. 
The terms trial and test functions are used in FEniCS-X too. The test and trial functions belong to certain _function spaces_ that specify the properties of the functions.

In the present case, we multiply the equation by a test function $v$ and  integrate over $\Omega$:

[[\int_\Omega -\nabla^2 u v \mathrm{d} x = \int_\Omega f v \mathrm{d} x]]

Here $\mathrm{d} x$ denotes the differential element for integration over the domain $\Omega$. We will later let $\mathrm{d} s$ denote the differential element for integration over the boundary of $\Omega$. 

A rule of thumb is that when we derive variational formulations is that one tries to keep the order of derivatives of $u$ and $v$ as small as possible. 
Here, we have a second-order differential of $u$, which can be transformed to a first derivative by employing the technique of 
[integration by parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts).
The formula reads 

[[ -\int_\Omega (\nabla^2 u)v \mathrm{d}x
= \int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla v \mathrm{d}x - \int_{\partial\Omega}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}v \mathrm{d}s ,]]

where $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\nabla u \cdot n$ is the derivative of $u$ in the outward normal direction $n$ on the boundary.

Another feature of variational formulations is that the test function $v$ is required to vanish on the parts of the boundary where the solution $u$ is known. See for instance [Langtangen, Mardal 2019](t1.md/#Langtangen_Mardal_FEM_2019).

In the present problem, this means that $v$ is $0$ on the whole boundary $\partial\Omega$. In the present problem, it means that the second term in the integration by parts formula is zero, and we have that 

[[\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \mathrm{d} x = \int_\Omega f v\mathrm{d} x]]

If we require that this equation holds for all test functions $v$ in some suitable space $\hat{V}$, the so-called _test space_, we obtain a well-defined mathematical problem that uniquely determines the solution $u$ which lies in some function space $V$. Note that $V$ does not have to be the same space as 
$\hat{V}$. We call the space $V$ the _trial space_. We refer to the equation above as the _weak form_/_variational form_ of the original boundary value problem. We now properly state our variational problem:
Find $u\in V$ such that 

[[\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \mathrm{d} x = \int_\Omega f v\mathrm{d} x\qquad \forall v \in \hat{V}.]]

For the present problem, the test and trial spaces $V$ and $\hat{V}$ is defined  as

[[ V=\\{v\in H^1(\Omega) \vert v=u_D \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega \\},]]

[[ \hat{V}=\\{v\in H^1(\Omega) \vert v=0 \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega \\}.]]

In short, $H^1(\Omega)$ is the Sobolev space containing functions $v$ such that $v^2$ and $\vert \nabla v \vert ^2$ have finite integrals over $\Omega$. The solution of the underlying
PDE must line in a function space where the derivatives are 
also continuous, but the Sobolev space $H^1(\Omega)$ allows functions with discontinuous derivatives.
This weaker continuity requirement in our weak formulation (caused by the integration by parts) is of great importance when it comes to constructing the finite element function space. In particular, it allows the use of piecewise polynomial function spaces. This means that the function spaces are constructed 
by stitching together polynomial functions on simple domains 
such as intervals, triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedrons and
hexahedrons. 

The variational problem is a _continuous problem_: it defines the solution $u$ in the infinite-dimensional function space $V$.
The finite element method for the  Poisson equation finds an approximate solution of the variational problem by replacing the infinite-dimensional function spaces $V$ and $\hat V$ by _discrete_ (finite dimensional) trial and test spaces $V_h\subset V$ and $\hat{V}_h \subset \hat{V}$. The discrete
variational problem reads: Find $u_h\in V_h$ such that 

[[\int_\Omega \nabla u_h \cdot \nabla v \mathrm{d} x = \int_\Omega fv \mathrm{d} x \quad \forall v \in \hat{V}_h.]]

This variational problem, together with suitable definitions of $V_h$ and $\hat{V}_h$ uniquely define our approximate numerical solution of the Poisson equation. 
Note that the boundary condition is encoded as part of the test and trial spaces. This might seem complicated at first glance, 
but means that the finite element variational problem and the continuous variational problem looks the same. 

## Abstract finite element variational formulation

We will introduce the following notations for variational problems:
Find $u\in V$ such that 

[[ a(u,v)=L(v)\qquad \forall v \in \hat{V}.]]

For the Poisson equation, we have:

[[ a(u,v)= \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \mathrm{d} x,]]

[[ L(v)= \int_{\Omega} fv \mathrm{d} x.]]

From literature $a(u,v)$ is known as the _bilinear form_ and $L(V)$ as a _linear form_. 
For every linear problem, we will identify all terms with the unknown $u$ and collect them in $a(u,v)$, and collect all terms with only  known functions in $L(v)$.

To solve a linear PDE in FEniCS-X, such as the Poisson equation, a user thus needs to perform two steps:

1. Choose the finite element spaces $V$ and $\hat{V}$ by specifying the domain (the mesh) and the type of function space (polynomial degree and type).
2. Express the PDE as a (discrete) variational problem: Find $u\in V$ such that $a(u,v)=L(v)$ for all $v \in \hat{V}$.

## Choosing a test problem
The Poisson problem has so far featured general domain $\Omega$ and general functions $u_D$ for the boundary conditions and $f$ for the right hand side.
Therefore, we need to make specific choices of $\Omega, u_D$ and $f$. A wise choice is to construct a problem  with a known analytical solution, so that we can check that the computed solution is correct. The primary candidates are lower-order polynomials. The continuous Galerkin finite element spaces of degree $r$ will exactly reproduce polynomials of degree $r$. 
Particularly, piecewise linear continuous Galerkin finite elements are able to exactly reproduce a quadratic polynomial on 
a uniformly partitioned mesh. We use these facts to construct a quadratic function in $2D$. In particular we choose

[[ u_e(x,y)=1+x^2+2y^2.]]

Inserting $u_e$ in the original boundary problem, we find that 
[[f(x,y)= -6,\qquad u_d(x,y)=u_e(x,y)=1+x^2+2y^2,]]
regardless of the shape of the domain as long as we prescribe 
$u_e$ on the boundary.

For simplicity, we choose the domain to be a unit square

[[\Omega=\[0,1\]\times \[0,1\] ]]

This simple but very powerful method for constructing test problems is called _the method of manufactured solutions_. 
First pick a simple expression for the exact solution, plug into
the equation to obtain the right-hand side (source term $f$). Then solve the equation with this right hand side, and using the exact solution as boundary condition. Finally, we create a program that tries to reproduce the exact solution.

Note that in many cases, it can be hard to determine if the program works if it produces an error of size $10^{-5}$ on a
$20 \times 20$ grid. However, since we are using Sobolev spaces,
we usually known about the numerical errors _asymptotic properties_. For instance that it is proportional to $h^2$ if $h$ is the size of a cell in the mesh. We can then compare the error on meshes with different $h$-values to see if the asymptotic behavior is correct. This technique will be explained in detail in a later chapter *FIXME: add correct reference*.

However, in cases where we have a solution we know that should have no approximation error, we know that the solution should
be produces to machine precision by the program.

# FEniCS-X implementation

A FEniCS-X program for solution our test problem for the Poisson equation with our choices of $\Omega, u_D$ and $f$ may look as follows:

```python
import dolfinx
import dolfinx.mesh
import dolfinx.plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot
import numpy
import ufl
from mpi4py import MPI
from petsc4py import PETSc

# Create the mesh and define function space
mesh = dolfinx.UnitSquareMesh(MPI.COMM_WORLD, 8, 8)
V = dolfinx.FunctionSpace(mesh, ("CG", 1))

# Define boundary condition
uD = dolfinx.Function(V)
uD.interpolate(lambda x: 1 + x[0]**2 + 2 * x[1]**2)
uD.vector.ghostUpdate(addv=PETSc.InsertMode.INSERT, mode=PETSc.ScatterMode.FORWARD)
fdim = mesh.topology.dim - 1
boundary_facets = dolfinx.mesh.locate_entities_boundary(mesh, fdim,
                                                        lambda x: numpy.full(x.shape[1], True, dtype=numpy.bool))
bc = dolfinx.DirichletBC(uD, dolfinx.fem.locate_dofs_topological(V, fdim, boundary_facets))

# Define variational problem
u = ufl.TrialFunction(V)
v = ufl.TestFunction(V)
f = dolfinx.Constant(mesh, -6)
a = ufl.inner(ufl.grad(u), ufl.grad(v)) * ufl.dx
L = ufl.inner(f, v) * ufl.dx

# Compute solution
uh = dolfinx.Function(V)
dolfinx.solve(a == L, uh, bc, petsc_options={"ksp_type": "preonly", "pc_type": "lu"})
uh.vector.ghostUpdate(addv=PETSc.InsertMode.INSERT, mode=PETSc.ScatterMode.FORWARD)

# Plot solution
dolfinx.plotting.plot(uh)
dolfinx.plotting.plot(mesh, color="k")
matplotlib.pyplot.savefig("uh.png")

# Compute error in L2 norm
error_L2 = numpy.sqrt(dolfinx.fem.assemble_scalar(ufl.inner(uh - uD, uh - uD) * ufl.dx))

# Compute maximum error at a dof
error_max = numpy.max(numpy.abs(uh.vector.array - uD.vector.array))

# Print errors
print("Error_L2 = {0:.2e}".format(error_L2))
print("Error_max = {0:.2e}".format(error_max))

```
The whole program can be found as a [Python-file](python_files/t1.py) and as a [Jupyter notebook](python_files/t1.ipynb).

## Dissection of the program

We will now dissect our FEniCS-X program in detail. 
The first eight lines of the program is importing the different modules required for solving the problem.
```python
import dolfinx
import dolfinx.cpp
import dolfinx.mesh
import dolfinx.plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot
import numpy
import ufl
from mpi4py import MPI
from petsc4py import PETSc
```
Not as opposed to a traditional FEniCS code, FEniCS-X is more modular. Instead of wrapping [MPI](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [PETSc](https://pypi.org/project/petsc4py/) modules inside dolfin-X, we would like to directly use the modules, as they are  well documented and makes dolfin-X easier
to understand.

# Generating  simple meshes
The next step is to define the discrete domain, _the mesh_
```python
mesh = dolfinx.UnitSquareMesh(MPI.COMM_WORLD, 8, 8, dolfinx.cpp.mesh.CellType.triangle)
```
which defines a uniform finite element mesh over the unit square $\[0,1]\times\[0, 1]$. The mesh consists of _cells_, which in 2D can be either triangles of quadrilaterals. Note that in addition to give how many elements we would like to have in each direction. We start by dividing the domain into $8\times 8$ quadrilaterals, which are subdivided into two triangles if
we will use triangular cells.
Note that we also supply the _MPI-communicator_. 
This is to specify how we would like the program to behave in parallel. If we supply `MPI.COMM_WORLD` we create a single mesh,
which data is distributed over the number of processors we 
would like to use. We can for instance run the program in 
parallel on two processors by using `mpirun`, as:
``` bash
 mpirun -n 2 python3 t1.py
```
However, if we would like to create a separate mesh on each processor, we can use `MPI.COMM_SELF`. This is for instance 
useful if we run a small problem, and would like to run it with
multiple parameters.
