title: "Fundamentals: Solving the Poisson equation"
---

The goal of this chapter is to solve one of the most basic PDEs, the Poisson equations, with a few lines of code in FEniCS-X. We start by introducing the most fundamental FEniCS objects, such as `Mesh`, `Function`, `FunctionSpace`, `TrialFunction` and `TestFunction`, and learn how to write a basic PDE solver. 
This will include:
- How to formulate a mathematical variational problem
- How to apply boundary conditions
- How to solve the discrete linear system
- How to visualize the solution

The Poisson equation is the following boundary-value problem

$$ -\nabla\cdot (\nabla u(x)) = f(x)$$
