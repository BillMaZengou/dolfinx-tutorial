title: "Fundamentals: Solving the Poisson equation"
---

The goal of this tutorial is to solve one of the most basic PDEs, the Poisson equations, with a few lines of code in FEniCS-X. We start by introducing the most fundamental FEniCS objects, such as `Mesh`, `Function`, `FunctionSpace`, `TrialFunction` and `TestFunction`, and learn how to write a basic PDE solver. 
This will include:
- How to formulate a mathematical variational problem
- How to apply boundary conditions
- How to solve the discrete linear system
- How to visualize the solution

The Poisson equation is the following boundary-value problem

[[ -\nabla^2 u(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}) \quad \mathbf{x} \in \Omega]]

[[ u(\mathbf{x}) = u_b(\mathbf{x})\quad \mathbf{x} \in \partial\Omega]]

Here, $u=u(\mathbf{x})$ is the unknown function, $f=f(\mathbf{x})$ is a prescribed function, $\nabla^2$ the Laplace operator, often written as $\Delta$, $\Omega$ the spatial domain, and $\partial\Omega$ is the boundary of $\Omega$. The Poisson problem, including both the PDE $-\nabla^2 u = f$ and the boundary condition $u=u_b$ on $\partial\Omega$, is an example of a _boundary-value problem_, which must be precisely state before it makes sense to start solving it numerically with FEniCS-X. 

In the two dimensional space with coordinates $x$ and $y$, we can expand the Poisson equation as

[[ -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} -
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y)]]

The unknown $u$ is now a function of two variables, $u=u(x,y)$, defined over the two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. 

The Poisson equation arises in numerous physical contexts, including
heat conduction, electrostatics, diffusion of substances, twisting of
elastic rods, inviscid fluid flow, and water waves. Moreover, the
equation appears in numerical splitting strategies for more complicated
systems of PDEs, in particular the Navier--Stokes equations.

Solving a boundary value problem in FEniCS consists of the following steps:

1. Identify the computational domain $\Omega$, the PDE, and its corresponding boundary conditions and source terms $f$.
2. Reformulate the PDE as a finite element variational problem.
3. Write a Python program defining the computational domain, the boundary conditions, the variational problem and the source terms, using FEniCS.
4. Run the Python program to solve the boundary-value problem. Optionally, you can extend the program to derive quantities such as fluxes and averages,
and visualize the results.

As we have already covered step 1., we shall now cover step 2.-4.

## Finite element variational formulation

FEniCS is based on the finite element method, which is a general and
efficient mathematical machinery for the numerical solution of
PDEs. The starting point for the finite element methods is a PDE
expressed in \emph{variational form}. For readers not familiar with variational problems, it is suggested to reading a proper book on the finite element method in addition, as this tutorial is meant as a brief introduction to the subject. See the [original tutorial]([The FEniCS tutorial](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319524610)) (Chapter 1.6.2).

The basic recipe for turning a PDE into a variational problem is:
- Multiply the PDE by a function $v$
- Integrate the resulting equation over the domain $\Omega$
- Perform integration by parts of terms with second order derivatives. 

The function $v$ which multiplies the PDE is called a _test function_. The unknown function $u$ that is to be approximated is referred to as a _trial function_. 
The terms trial and test functions are used in FEniCS-X too. The test and trial functions belong to certain _function spaces_ that specify the properties of the functions.

In the present case, we multiply the equation by a test function $v$ and  integrate over $\Omega$:

[[\int_\Omega -\nabla^2 u v \mathrm{d} x = \int_\Omega f v \mathrm{d} x]]

Here $\mathrm{d} x$ denotes the differential element for integration over the domain $\Omega$. We will later let $\mathrm{d} s$ denote the differential element for integration over the boundary of $\Omega$.
