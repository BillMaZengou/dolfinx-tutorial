# Welcome to the Dolfin-X tutorial

This webpage gives a concise overview of the functionality of [Dolfin-X](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/), including a gentle introduction to the finite element method. This webpage is an adaptation of the [FEniCS tutorial](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319524610).

Dolfin-X can be used as either a C++ or Python software, but this tutorial will focus on Python programming, as it is the simplest and most effective approach for beginners. After having gone through this tutorial, the reader should familiarize themselfs with the Dolfin-X [documentation](https://fenicsproject.org/docs/dolfinx/dev/python/), which includes the API and numerous demos.
